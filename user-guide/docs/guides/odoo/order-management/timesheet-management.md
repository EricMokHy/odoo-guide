## Impact of Timesheets on Sales Orders and Invoices

1. **Sales Order Impact:**
      - Timesheets linked to a sales order contribute to the projectâ€™s actual cost records.
      - Helps in comparing estimated labor costs (from the cost sheet) with actual labor expenses.

2. **Invoice Generation:**
      - For products with **Timesheet-Based** or **Milestone** invoicing policies, approved timesheets trigger invoiceable lines.
      - Invoices are generated based on the hours logged and the associated billing rate.

3. **Financial Reporting:**
      - Accurate timesheet data supports detailed project cost reports and profitability analysis.

## Manager Review Process

1. **Access Timesheet Reports:**
      - Go to **Timesheets** or **Projects** module and select **Reports**.

2. **Filter by Sales Order or Project:**
      - Use filters to narrow down the timesheets related to specific sales orders or projects.

3. **Review Logged Hours:**
      - Check for accuracy in hours logged, task completion status, and any notes added by team members.

4. **Approve or Request Changes:**
      - Approve timesheets if they align with project expectations.
      - Request corrections if discrepancies are found.

## Best Practices

- **Track Time in Real-Time:** Avoid manual entries when possible to ensure accuracy.
- **Review Timesheets Regularly:** Managers should review timesheets weekly to maintain accurate billing cycles.
- **Align Timesheets with Milestones:** Ensure logged hours contribute to project milestones where applicable.

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Timesheet Not Reflected in Sales Order

- **Check Task Assignment:** Ensure the task is correctly linked to the sales order.
- **Verify Project and Sales Order Binding:** The project associated with the task must also be bound to the correct sales order.

### 2. Invoices Not Generating from Timesheets

- **Review Product Invoicing Policy:** Make sure the product's invoicing policy is set to **Timesheet-Based** or **Milestone**.
- **Approve Timesheets:** Only approved timesheets generate invoiceable lines.

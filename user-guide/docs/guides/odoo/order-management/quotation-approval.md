# USC Odoo User Guide - Quotation Approval

## Overview
The quotation approval process ensures that all quotations meet company standards before they are sent to customers. At USC, only authorized personnel can approve quotations, and the approval process involves validating both the content of the quotation and the attached cost sheet.

## Key Rules

- **Authorized Approvers:** Only **Steven** and **Jakin** are authorized to approve quotations.
- **Cost Sheet Requirement:** A cost sheet must be attached to every quotation. Quotations without a cost sheet will be automatically rejected.
- **Approval Method:** Quotations must be reviewed and approved via email confirmation since there is no built-in Odoo approval function.

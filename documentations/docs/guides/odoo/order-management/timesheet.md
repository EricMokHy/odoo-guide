## Tracking Milestones Personally

- **Individual Milestone Tracking:**
     - Users can monitor their own progress towards project milestones by checking the completion status of assigned tasks.
     - When a task is completed, it contributes to the overall milestone completion percentage.

- **Impact on Project Billing:**
     - Completed tasks and milestones can trigger invoicing if the productâ€™s invoicing policy is set to **Milestone** or **Timesheet-Based**.



---

## Invoicing with Timesheets

- **Timesheet-Based Invoicing:**
   - Projects and products configured with a **Timesheet-Based** invoicing policy will generate invoices based on approved timesheet entries.
   - Each approved timesheet entry contributes to the billable amount in the sales order or project invoice.

- **Milestone Invoicing Integration:**
   - When milestones are completed, associated timesheets help validate the work done, ensuring accurate invoicing.

## Best Practices

- **Accurate Time Tracking:** Start and stop timers correctly or enter manual times with precision.
- **Regular Timesheet Updates:** Avoid backdating or bulk entries to maintain transparency.
- **Monitor Milestone Progress:** Keep an eye on personal milestones to align work with project billing stages.

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Timesheet Not Syncing with Project

- **Check Task Assignment:** Ensure the user is assigned to the correct task in the project.
- **Verify Permissions:** Make sure the user has permission to log timesheets for the specific project.

### 2. Issues with WeChat Mini App

- **Ensure App Integration:** Confirm that the app is connected to Odoo correctly.
- **Update Timesheets Manually:** If the app is not syncing, timesheets can be updated manually in the Odoo interface.
